===============

Once you’ve set up the projection and project folder, you’ll enter the Main Window, the central workspace in Kalpa.

Here’s a quick overview of its components:

1. Visualization Window

    This is where your loaded data is displayed.

    You can control the camera view by repositioning, rotating, and zooming.

2. Menu Bar

    The menu bar provides access to various options, such as loading data, processing tools, and applying workflows.

3. Axes Tool

    This interactive tool shows the current orientation of the camera and allows you to adjust it directly.

4. Tool Bar

    Quickly change the camera's position along different axes using the toolbar.

5. Coordinates Display

    Displays the current coordinates of the mouse pointer in the active projection. Visualise legend layer legends.

6. RAM Utilization Panel

    Provides a live view of the total, system, and application RAM usage, helping you monitor resource consumption.

By now, you should have a good understanding of Kalpa's starting and main windows. In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into loading data and configuring layers for visualization.
