Setting up project folder
=========================

- In the Starting Window, youâ€™ll also set up your **Project Folder**. This is where all intermediate outputs, including data files, figures, models, and legends, are automatically saved. 
- If you plan to work with **high-resolution** or **large datasets**, consider setting this folder on an external hard drive to manage storage efficiently.
